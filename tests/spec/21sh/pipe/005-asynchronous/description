The purpose of this test is to check that the Shell waits for all the commands specified in a pipeline to complete before looking after the next command line. In this test, the first command of the pipeline takes a longer time to complete than the next one, so that the outputs should appear in a reverse order. The Shell should wait for the two processes to complete and then launch the second command line.
