The purpose of this test is to check if the bracket expansion works with the following pattern []-z].
One test use the following range which is the default range for bash:
< > , ; : ! ' " ( ) [ ] { } @ $ \ # % 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a A b B c C d D e E f F g G h H i I j J k K l L m M n N o O p P q Q r R s S t T u U v V w W x X y Y z
The other use the ascii value, which does make more sense.
